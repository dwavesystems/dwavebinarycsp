    ``dwavebinarycsp`` is deprecated and will be removed in Ocean 10.
    For solving problems with constraints, we recommend using the hybrid
    solvers in the Leap service.
    You can find documentation for the hybrid solvers at :ref:`opt_index_hybrid`.

`dwavebinarycsp` currently provides factories for constraints representing
Boolean gates and satisfiability problems and CSPs for circuits and satisfiability
problems.

Constraints
===========

.. automodule:: dwavebinarycsp.factories.constraint

Gates

Satisfiability Problems
-----------------------

.. autosummary::

   sat.sat2in4

CSPs
